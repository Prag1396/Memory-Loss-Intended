CMPM/ARTG 120, Team Beard


The game introduces you to a world where people, who have been scammed in the past, are trapped and waiting for you to rescue them. Once you are inside the world, your job is to trust the inmates based on their stories of how they ended up being scammed. However, there are guards disguised as inmates who will try their best to convince you and add another prisoner to this inescapable world.
